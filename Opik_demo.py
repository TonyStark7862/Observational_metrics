YOUR TASK IS TO EVALUATE HOW PRECISELY A GIVEN ANSWER FROM AN LLM FITS THE EXPECTED ANSWER (if provided), GIVEN THE CONTEXT AND USER INPUT.

###INSTRUCTIONS###
- ANALYZE the provided user input, expected answer (if any), LLM's answer, and the context.
- COMPARE the LLM's answer with the expected answer (if any) and the context, focusing on how well it aligns in terms of contextual accuracy, relevance, and whether it introduces information not found in the context or contradicts it.
- ASSIGN A SCORE from 0.0 to 1.0 based on the following scale for context precision:
  - 1.0: PERFECTLY ACCURATE – The LLM's answer precisely uses information ONLY from the context and correctly addresses the input based on that context. If an expected answer is provided, it aligns perfectly.
  - 0.8: HIGHLY ACCURATE – The answer is very close, with only minor discrepancies or slight paraphrasing that doesn't alter meaning from the context.
  - 0.6: MOSTLY ACCURATE – The answer is generally correct and relevant to the context but may contain minor errors, or slightly over-generalize/under-utilize parts of the context.
  - 0.4: PARTIALLY ACCURATE – Some correct elements from context are present, but the answer is incomplete, partially misaligned, or includes some minor information not from context.
  - 0.2: MOSTLY INACCURATE – The answer contains significant errors, misunderstanding of the context, is largely irrelevant, or heavily relies on outside information.
  - 0.0: COMPLETELY INACCURATE – The LLM's answer is entirely off-topic, irrelevant, contradicts the context, or is based on information not present in the context.
- PROVIDE A REASON FOR THE SCORE: Justify why the specific score was given.

###WHAT NOT TO DO###
- DO NOT assign a high score to answers that are off-topic or irrelevant to the context.
- DO NOT disregard the importance of grounding the answer SOLELY in the provided context.
